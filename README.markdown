Grammy
======

Description
-----------
Grammy is a DSL that generates recursive descent parsers. The DSL is inspired by
the boost::spirit parser framework for c++. I try to keep the DSL as close 
as possible to EBNF syntax but add several parsing-features to it (e.g. Skippers, Error detection, lists). 

General Information
------------------------------

- Ruby 1.9.1 only (using features that are not part of 1.8.6/7)
- Requires ruby-graphviz for writing an AST to an image file
- Require log4r for logging

Installation
------------

`git clone` the repository, `cd` into the directory and execute `rake gem`. 
Then do `sudo gem install pkg/Grammy-x.x.x.gem`.

Features
--------

- Most EBNF features: Sequences, Repetition, Alternatives, Optional rules, Regex rules
- Shortcut for lists: `list` and `list?`
- Skipping of characters: comments, whitespaces between words
- Generation of an AST. Most unused tokens can be removed automatically.
- AST can be written to an image file with help of ruby-graphviz.
- Error handling: disable backtracking with the `&` operator and get simple syntax error reports

Recent Changes
--------------
- Optional rules can now be defined inside `[]`: `rule a => 'maybe' >> [x >> +y]`
- Added an `AST::Walker` that can be used to traverse an AST
- Regex rules
- rules now dont need to be symbols. They are implemented via `method_missing` 
	returning the method name as symbol. This is closer to BNF. Also later on 
	parameters might be passed: `rule x(param1) => other_rule(param2) >> '.'`

Todo
----

- Combining of regex rules: `token x => /[a-z]+/ | /[_]+/`
- Subtraction: `+('a'..'z') - 'reserved'`
- semantic actions
- validation (rules which never match, left recursion)
- much more: see `doc/todo.txt`

Define a grammar
----------------

First: `require 'Grammy'`

### Empty Grammar
All grammars in Grammy are defined inside a define-block:

	g = Grammy.define :optional_name do
		# rules here
	end

### Regex-Rules:
The following BNF grammar:

	<sometoken> ::= ('a' | ... | 'z')+ ('0' | .. | '9')*
	
can be defined in grammy like this:

	rule sometoken ::= /[a-z]+[0-9]*/

### Sequences
The following BNF grammar:

	<myrule> ::= 'test' 'other'

can be defined in grammy like this:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule myrule => 'test' >> 'other'
	end

The `>>` is the sequence operator which indicates that the string `'test'`
should be followed by the string `'other'`.


### Alternatives
The BNF grammar:

	<lower> ::= 'a' | 'b' | .. | 'z'

can be defined like this:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule lower => 'a' | 'b' | .. | 'z'
	end

or shorter:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule lower => 'a'..'z'
	end

So the range is a shortcut.

### Repetition
The following BNF grammar:

	<digits> ::= (1 | 2 | .. | 9)+

can be defined like this:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule digits => +('1'..'9')
	end

So the `+` operator (Kleene-cross) has just to be in front of the subrule that should be repeated.
The `~` operator used in grammy is the equivalent to the kleene-star (0..infinite repetitions).
Like the `+` operator, `~` has to stand in front of the rule that should be repeated.
Constant repetition like `'a' * 4` and ranged repetition like `'a' * (0..7)` is
also possible (`+`, `~` and constant repetitions are just special cases of ranged repetitions).

### Multiple rules

The following BNF grammar with multiple rules:

	<lower> ::= 'a' | .. | 'z'
	<upper> ::= 'A' | .. | 'Z'
	<letter> ::= <lower> | <upper>
	<word> ::= <letter>+

is defined like this:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule lower => 'a'..'z'
		rule upper => 'A'..'Z'
		rule letter => lower | upper
		rule word => +letter
	end

### Optional rules
The following BNF grammar with an optional rule:

	<optional> ::= ['a']

can be defined like this:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule optional => ['a']
	end

or like this:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule a => 'a'
		rule optional => a?
	end

So you can use the `[]` or you have to append a `?` to the name of a helper rule.

### EOS Rule

You can use the `eos` rule to match the end of a string:

	g = Grammy.define do
		start words => 'hello' >> 'world' >> eos
	end

### List Rule

Lists are things that often occur in grammars, e.g. a parameter list:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule item => ('a'..'z')*(2..8)
		start items => item >> ~(',' >> item)
	end

Since this occurs very often and is not very readable, there is a shortcut for lists:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule item => ('a'..'z')*(2..8)
		start items => list(item)
	end

The seperator can be specified with the second parameter of `list` (default is ',').

### Lookahead rule (experimental)

Lookahead rules are used to check the existence of a node without consuming it: 

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule a_followed_by_b => 'a' >> lookahead('b')
		rule b => 'b'
	end

You can also do negative lookaheads:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule a_not_followed_by_b => 'a' >> lookahead_negative('b')
		rule b => 'b'
	end

Parsing
-------
You can use the defined grammar to parse strings:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule lower => 'a'..'z'
		rule upper => 'A'..'Z'
		rule letter => lower | upper
		rule word => +letter
	end
	
	result = g.parse("someword", rule: :word)
	result.full_match? #=> true

	result = g.parse("someword", rule: :letter)
	result.full_match? #=> false
	result.partial_match? #=> true

Most grammars have a start rule. You can set that start rule inside the grammar:

	g = Grammy.define do
		rule lower => 'a'..'z'
		rule upper => 'A'..'Z'
		rule letter => lower | upper
		start word => +letter # this is now the start rule
	end

The rule `word` is now the start rule. If no rule is supplied to `parse`, then the start rule is used.

Skipping
--------
Often you want to skip several parts of the grammar (e.g whitespaces or comments).
Thats what a skipper does:

	g = Grammy.define do
		default_skipper whitespacs => +' '
		start words => 'hello' >> 'world'
	end

The skipper now skips whitespaces when parsing:

	g.parse("hello        world").full_match? #=> true
	g.parse("helloworld").no_match? #=> true

You dont want to skip in every rule. Skippers are disabled when you declare the rule as `token`:

	g = Grammy.define do
		default_skipper whitespacs => +' '
		token word => +('a'..'z') # no skipping between the characters
		start words => 'hello' >> 'world' >> word
	end

You can use multiple skippers:

	g = Grammy.define do
		default_skipper a_skipper => ~'a'
		skipper b_skipper => ~'b'

		rule content => +'+', skipper: :b_skipper
		start enclosed_content => '{' >> content >> '}'
	end

	g.should fully_match("aaa{aabb+bbbb+baa}")

The default skipper is used by all rules (except tokens and fragments) by default.
You can change the skipper from default to a custom one by passing the name of the skipper (`skipper: :b_skipper`) as
extra parameter like in the example above.

AST Generation
--------------
When parsing a string an abstract syntax tree is generated for the string:

![image of example AST](http://ragmaanir.mypresident.de/images/example_ast.png)

The AST can be accessed like this:

	t = g.parse("helloworld").tree
	t.data #=> "helloworld", the string that got matched by this node
	t.children #=> array of child nodes

To output the AST there are two methods:

 - as string: `tree.to_string_tree`
 - as image: `tree.to_image('my_ast')` # graphviz required. default output format is '.png'

Many substrings that are matched by the grammar are automatically *not* included in the AST:

- characters matched by a skipper
- rules without a name dont create AST-Nodes:

	`rule a => +('a'..'z')`

	This creates only *one* node for the rule 'a'. Not one for each character.

AST - Walker
------------
An AST-Walker traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree constructed by the parser. 
A Walker can be built by using a simple DSL:

	my_context = class Context
		def add_class(name); ... ;end
		def close_class(name); ... ;end
		def current_class; ... ;end
	end.new
	
	@walker = AST::Walker::Builder.new(context: my_context) do
	
		before(:class_def) do |class_def|
			add_class(class_def[:class_name]) # create a new empty class
		end
		
		after(:class_def) do |class_def|
			close_class(class_def[:class_name]) # adding attributes and methods is finished now
		end

		after(:attribute_def) do |attr_def|
			current_class.add_attribute(attr_def[:attr_name],...)
		end
	end

The `before` and `after` methods register a block with the name of nodes. When 
the Walker visits a node with that name the registered block is called with 
the node as its parameter. Blocks registered with `before` are called before 
descendants of the node have been visited. Blocks registered with `after` are 
called after the descendant nodes have been visited. The AST::Walker traverses the 
tree in a top-down and left-to-right direction.

The context-object is used to store information between calls of the registered blocks. 
Method calls inside of the blocks are delegated to the context-object. So the context-object 
can be used to store symbols, types, classes, variables, scopes, generated code, errors and other things.

The Walker can be applied to an AST in the following way:

	@walker.walk(mygrammar.parse(input).tree)


Error Detection
---------------

The operator '&' which behaves like the '>>' operator disables backtracking. This means:

	rule err_seq => 'aaa' & 'bbb'

Is nearly equivalent to:

	rule seq => 'aaa' >> 'bbb'

With the exception that when err_seq matches 'aaa' in the input, backtracking is disabled,
so the next string in the input MUST be 'bbb', otherwise a SyntaxError is added
to the errors array of the ParseResult returned by Grammar#parse.

SyntaxErrors look like this when written to console:

For:

	g.parse("aaabb").errors.first

the output is:

	Syntax error
	| in source 'unknown'
	| in line 1 at column 4
	| "aaabb"
	| ----^
	| Expected: 'bbb'
	| In Rule: err_seq -> 'aaa' 'bbb'

And for:

	g.parse("aaaBBB").errors.first

the message is:

	Syntax error
	| in source 'unknown'
	| in line 1 at column 4
	| "aaaBBB"
	| ----^
	| Expected: 'bbb'
	| In Rule: err_seq -> 'aaa' 'bbb'

You can specify the source by passing it as option to the Grammy#parse method:

	g.parse("aaaBBB", source: 'XXX').errors.first
	
resulting in:

	Syntax error
	| in source 'XXX'
	| in line 1 at column 4
	| "aaaBBB"
	| ----^
	| Expected: 'bbb'
	| In Rule: err_seq -> 'aaa' 'bbb'


Debugging
---------

You can see what the parser is doing when you turn debugging on:

	g.parse("some input", debug: true)

Or shorter:

	g.parse!("some input")

Performance
-----------

Use Regex instead of Alternatives for Tokens:

	token x => +('a'..'z')
	
is slower than:

	token x => /[a-z]+/

Testing
-------

There are several rspec tests which might inspire you (e.g. common_grammars_spec.rb).

For very complex grammars you can do something like this:

#### `your_grammar_spec.yaml`
	-
	  name: "Empty class"
	  code: |
		  class EmptyClass {
		  }
	-
	  name: "Class with variable"
	  code: |
		  class VarCls {
			var x : Int = 3
		  }

#### `your_grammar_spec.rb`
	describe "YAML specs: " do
		yaml_specs = YAML.load_file('spec/spec.yaml')

		yaml_specs.each do |spec|
			it spec['name'] do
				result = @grammar.parse(spec['code'], debug: spec['debug'])
				
				if not result.full_match? or result.has_errors?
					puts result.errors
					result.tree.to_image(spec['name'].gsub(' ','_'))
					raise RuntimeError, "failed"
					# maybe supply File.dirname(__FILE__)+'/spec.yaml:#{line_number_here}'
				end
			end
		end
	end

You basically define a lot of valid example input in a yaml file an 
test if each of example is matched. 

*NOTE*: This might be integrated in a Test-Suite for Grammy.

Also there are some custom rspec matchers in spec/support:

	g.should fully_match("input1","input2",...)
	g.should partially_match(...)
	g.should not_match(...)

Useful Things
-------------

- **`Rule#to_bnf`**

	Is used to output a rule in BNF like syntax. This is also used in syntax error output.

		rule hash_entry => (hash_sym | expression >> '=>') & expression
		[...]
		g.rules[:hash_entry].to_bnf #=> hash_entry -> (hash_sym | expression '=>') expression

- **`Hash#with_default`**

	This assigns values to keys that are not assigned yet (this means the key is not present).

		{a: nil, b: 5}.with_default(a: true, b: nil, c: 6) #=> {a: nil, b: 5, c: 6}
		
	AFAIK this is the same as active\_supports `reverse_merge`
